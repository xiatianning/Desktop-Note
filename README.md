## Description ##
This is a note taking application with a list view and a grid view. You can create new notes, delete existing notes, and clear all existing ones. A note has a text body and can be marked as “archived” or "starred". There is a filter to show only active notes. Also, you can sort notes based on several options, which are: length in ascending (shortest first) or descending order (longest first), alphabetically in ascending or descending order, and starred notes first. Alphabetical sorting is case-sensitive. Starred First means displaying starred notes at top.
